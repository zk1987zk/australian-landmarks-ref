         <p>As the feedback suggests, the card game was substitute with another game which uses the same principle of "Mastermind" to place 4 to 6 images of landmarks in an order based on the time of completion.  The images in the wrong order will be shown in the red colour. Fewer steps the users take to sort those images in the correct order, more points they will get. With all those ideas in mind, I quickly made the paper prototypes of the application.</p>

         <p>With the aid of the paper prototype, I started to implement our concept into coding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I created the basic structure of the application which includes homepage, application page, instruction page and all other pages and linked them together. I also prepared a power point slide show for the first presentation of our application. </p>

         <a href="img/First structure/simple.jpg" rel="lightbox[First structure]" title="Basic structure"><img class = 'photos' src="img/First structure/simple.jpg" alt="" /></a>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

         <p>In the presentation, the basic structure and components of our application are firstly introduced. Then the changes such as background colour, structure and font size are explained. The feedbacks and suggestions we receive are which some of the images generated from Trove are either broken or not relevant. Therefore, we must find a way to filter those images out. Also, during the test, it is found that only the man-made landmarks have an accurate time of construction accomplishment. Consequently, our range of images resources are then limited to only those artificial landmarks, since the natural landmarks don't have a exact accomplishment date, they cannot be included in our application. </p>

         <p>For the next stage, our primary target was to set a precondition for selecting the images generated from Trove.  The ordering check method needs to be changed so that the application could also include the natural ones. Lastly, a score system would be implemented to increase the challenging and entertaining value. </p>


         <h1><span id='quotationMark'>Reflection</span></h1>
         <p>At this stage, the importance of the teamwork became more appealing. When everyone's efforts were combined together, the work used to be considered difficult suddenly becomes so much easier.  I would say our group was in a very good shape and everything was going well so far in this stage. The only concern we were facing was that most of us don't have much experience in coding. As we had to check the order of image like "Mastermind", the coding must be complicated. Also, the score system would be another challenge for us since none of us had learnt anything about the database. However, I still believed if we work hard, those challenges could be conquered. </p>

         <p>For the paper prototype, I firstly thought it might be a waste of time as the final product might be totally different from the prototype, but I was totally wrong. Even though there were limitations in our prototypes since the images were fake, users couldn't really get the full experience or expectations from the prototype. However, from the prototype, users could have a basic understanding of the application including structures, interaction, playability so feedbacks would be much more closely related and appropriate than the way of just talking to them about the products. </p>

         <p>I once again realised that sharpening the axe won't interfere with the cutting of firewood and you have to build the house by laying one block by another. The prototype was a very good proof of this statement.  To be honest, I felt so thankful for those people who provided us those valuable advices. Without them, we probably wouldn't ever be able to think of those new ideas. Those feedbacks were like sparks of inspiration which really could change a fate of a product. On the other hand, it was hard to deny the fact that hearing the complements was enjoyable and flattery to myself. However, the ideas I found most useful were still those critiques which could really bring a new idea to us as a new life to a dead plant. </p>
