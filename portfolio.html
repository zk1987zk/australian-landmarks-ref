         <h1><span id='quotationMark'>Portfolio</span></h1>
         <p>I start designing the portfolio by looking at all the examples provided first. In the beginning, I was trying to make it look sophisticated but then I realise that it is unnecessary since the purpose of portfolio is mainly to show your work, so I decided to use black and white colour to be my main scheme because the contrast is simple and easy to read. The blue colour is one of my favourites, so I decided to use it as a bit decoration.</p>

         <p>My first idea was to make an entry page so when user opens my portfolio, they will see a nice image to refresh their mind. However, later I thought this is unnecessary so I reject this option. Then in my second prototype, I decided to put the image in the corner for decorating purpose, but later I found this is also a bit awkward when the image doesn't actually balance out the whole space in the background of the website. Again, I rejected it. The drop down makes it easier to navigate through the web page. </p>

         <a href="img/Portfolio concept/original1.jpg" rel="lightbox[Portfolio concept]" title="Original ideas"><img class = 'photos' src="img/Portfolio concept/original1.jpg" alt="" /></a>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         <a href="img/Portfolio concept/original2.jpg" rel="lightbox[Portfolio concept]" title="Original ideas"><img class = 'photos' src="img/Portfolio concept/original2.jpg" alt="" /></a>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         <a href="img/Portfolio concept/original3.jpg" rel="lightbox[Portfolio concept]" title="Original ideas"><img class = 'photos' src="img/Portfolio concept/original3.jpg" alt="" /></a>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         <a href="img/Portfolio concept/actual.jpg" rel="lightbox[Portfolio concept]" title="Actual website"><img class = 'photos' src="img/Portfolio concept/actual.jpg" alt="" /></a>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

         <p>Finally, I decided to just use a footer underneath and added the logo. In able to attract users' attention and serve a clean guideline for them, I made some interactive buttons in the homepage. This is also a standard practise for a modern website design principle. The buttons were designed using JavaScript for changing between hovering and clicking status. This kind of effect was used to increase the interactive value of the web site so the user would know this is a button by a direct look. </p>
 
         <h1><span id='quotationMark'>Reflection</span></h1>
         <p>I certainly enjoyed doing the portfolio because I can improve the skills and knowledge I've learnt from the web design course and it also allows me to freely design a web page in the styles which I like.  Because of its flexibility, I could experiment on those techniques which I am unable to apply on the previous work. </p>

         <p>For example in this portfolio, I learnt a new way of creating a images gallery which is better looking. Also, I created those interactive buttons which I didn't have a chance to finish in the previous course. To be honest, I am still not satisfied enough with the current level of interactivity because it is only created by using three different images. Some of the professional websites I have seen have much more attractive interactive buttons. </p>

         <p>For the next portfolio, I wish I could make it more interesting and functional. Even though I have improved my web designing skills by now, I still would like to learn more. As you can see, I keep my portfolio simple for users to navigate more easily but sometimes I feel my website is rather dull and boring. As a result, I would like to know how to maintain the attractiveness while keeping the simplicity. </p>
