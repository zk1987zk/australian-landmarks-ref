         <p>Without doubt, the computing design studio is one of my favourite courses. This is a complete new experience for me. Not like many other projects I have done before, the clear guidelines are provided to the students, but this course doesn't have a fixed solution. This allows me to create whatever I like but without dispute, sometimes it is hard to know what to do next.</p>

         <p>Considering about our level of experience and skill, I would say our application "Australian Landmarks" is successful in overall even though there are still some flaws in our finished application. For instance, we couldn't figure out how to change the method of moving the images just simply by clicking instead of dragging. Also, the information generated from Trove about the landmarks is not closely relevant to the history so the educational purpose is greatly reduced.</p> 

         <p>For the future improvements of this application, the score system definately needs to be implemented first since this could greatly improve the entertaining value of our application so to attract more users. Then the next step would be to improve the user experience which includes the images moving method from just dragging to clicking. The visual effect could be used more often to, for example, notify users which image is in wrong order. The information shown to user needs to be more specific and educational. Ultimately, this application could be expanded to include all the places around Australia so users can learn huge amount of historical knowledge about Australia.</p>

         <p>Even though I haven't achieved all of what I have wished, the skills I have learnt from building this application is very valuable. From this course, I have learned a lot more about designing profession. From DECO 1100 and 1400, all the knowledge we have learned have been tested and reviewed. There is indeed no perfect solution for the design. It is not simply something like turning your idea to reality but rather, it is how you can manipulate with the limited resources, knowledge and experience, guiding with your instinct and series of brainstorming, test, analysis and evaluation to create another new reality.</p>
