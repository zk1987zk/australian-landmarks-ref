         <h1><span id='quotationMark'>Design Proposal</span></h1>
         <p>In DECO 1800 this year, students acted like a deisgning team which is called by Brisbane City Coucil to redesign the Australian National Library website, so to create a fun way of retreiving the data. Firstly, we were asked to explore the Trove and also learned how Trove API works. Then, we were separated into six groups to discuss about the information which can be obtained from Trove. As this project is to make the way of retrieving data from Trove more interesting, we must firstly understand which kind of data in Trove could be implemented. We wrote all the ideas on board and then categorised all those types of data under each section of Trove website.</p>
 
         <p>We were then taught how to use Json and how to modify the search result from Trove. Everyone's ideas were put together and categorised according to their types such as "games, quizzes, music/sound" and etc. This allowed everyone to explore different ideas from the others. People who shared the same interest in one particular idea formed a group which consists about 4 or 5 people. </p>

         <p>My original idea was to create an application which allows users to explore the images of different places of Brisbane between a certain range of years, so people would be able to see how Brisbane changes over time. Therefore I made a prototype for "Brisbane's time machine". However, the group didn't like my idea and they preferred to build a game which users need to pick the two cards which represent the same place but in different time. Through the testing of this game, feedback given was that the coding was hard to build such an application. So again we had to change the card game to placing the images of the landmarks from earlier time to older. </p>

         <h1><span id='quotationMark'>Reflection</span></h1>
         <p> I am the type of person who likes daydreaming about travelling to the past. I am often curious about how some places looked like in the old times and how they evolved, so my idea is to build the application acting like a time machine, so I chose a group which shared a similar idea with me. Suprisingly, Most of the ideas from other groups were based on the "timeline" section. I guess it was because this idea was the most obvious since there are a lot of articles, journal and information from the past in Trove. </p>

         <p>The feedback provided for us was that my idea was the simplest among all other members. That wass because I believed a simple idea sometimes has greater chance to succeed and the feedback given from teachers has supported my point of view. Many of the other teams' ideas are great and even perfect, but they were also told it would be difficult to implement data from Trove for developing this application. </p>
         
         <p>However, my idea is rejected by the group because the other members think it is too simple. I felt a bit disappointed because it could be hard for us to build a complicated application as we are lacking of the skills and experience. </p>
